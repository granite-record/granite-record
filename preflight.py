"""
Run every check that needs no network, and report all of them at once.

    python3 preflight.py            # everything
    python3 preflight.py --code     # logic only, ignore the data on disk
    python3 preflight.py --verbose  # show what each check actually produced

The failure this exists to prevent: twelve files change, the first one raises on
line 3, and an hour goes into that one traceback while the other eleven stay
unknown. Nothing here stops at the first failure. Every check is independent,
catches its own exceptions, and reports. What you get is a list of what is
broken, not the first thing that broke.

This is the companion to inventory.py, not a replacement. That answers "am I
running the copy you gave me". This answers "does the copy I am running work".
Run inventory first; a failure here on a stale file is not worth debugging.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO

No network, no YouTube, no gencourt. It never runs a build and never writes
anything into the project: the marker checks build a throwaway tree under the
system temp directory and delete it. Running this cannot change the site and
cannot lose anything.

TWO HALVES

CODE checks call the changed functions with fixed inputs and known answers.
They run anywhere, need no data, and prove the logic works on your Python
before it meets 2,234 bills.

DATA checks run only when the real files are present, and are read-only. They
answer the questions the code cannot: what shape former_members.json really is,
what the manifest's venue values look like, how many docket rows the proceeding
parser drops on the floor.

HB 1418, setting a minimum affirmative vote for new or expanded spending.
MAJORITY: OUGHT TO PASS. MINORITY: INEXPEDIENT TO LEGISLATE.
Rep. Ross Berry for the Majority of Election Law. This legislation applies
only to towns and school districts that use the official ballot system. In
many towns turnout is extremely low, often around 15 percent. Vote 12-8.
Rep. Jim Maggiore for the Minority of Election Law. This limitation has
prevented many towns from adopting SB 2, concentrating budgetary decisions
among a relatively small number of attendees. It aligns with changes made
in 2025 through HB 394, which established that representatives serve in an
ex-officio capacity. For these reasons the minority opposes the motion.

HB 1419, relative to something else entirely.
OUGHT TO PASS.
Rep. Dan McGuire for Election Law. The committee heard testimony from the
sponsor and from two municipal clerks, and found the change to be a plain
correction of a cross-reference rather than a matter of policy. No member
spoke against it and the vote was unanimous. Vote 18-0.
